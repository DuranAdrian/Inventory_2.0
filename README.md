# Inventory_2.0

This project is my first functional, although a bit buggy at times, personal iOS project that was started by attempting to solve my simple inventory tracking needs.

Using Core Data, TableViews, CollectionViews, Storyboard, Protocols, a third party plugin [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) and an online tutorial for [cloud tags](https://iostutorialjunction.com/2017/10/create-tag-clouds-view-in-swift-tutorial.html) I was able to create an app that was able to suit my needs. Although there are other Inventory iOS apps out there, I decided to create my own for the challenge and to learn more about iOS Development. 

The app contains the following core features:
* Create new items
* View an item's details
* Custom folders
* Add items to custom folders
* Category folders auto created and deleted when empty

I decided to leave this project as it is as a testament to my continuing software development skills. I hope to one day be able to come back to this app in the future and see how far I've come and possiblely rebuild it with skills I have learned.

Side note: I had a bit of local technical issue with Inventory_1.0 and decided to create Inventory_2.0.
